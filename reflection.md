- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
I have a better understanding of the relationship between the classes and I was able to manifest that into my coding and constructin of the classes.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I'm still a little confused about how the Engine's methods interact with that of the train (like can the Train use go() or do we have to get the Engine first?). But otherwise I feel like I did well in the other parts.
